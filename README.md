# Inventory Application

A database webapp project, made as part of The Odin Project. It uses [Express](https://expressjs.com), [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org), [EJS](https://ejs.co), [node-postgres](https://node-postgres.com), and [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv).

## Media System Database

This example database webapp catalogues my media consumptionâ€”books, shows, and games. (See [cobb.land/media](https://cobb.land/media/) for an example of how I do this without a database.)

There are users. There are carts. Each user has carts. Each cart a user has can have one of four states: playlist, shelf, bin, and trash.
